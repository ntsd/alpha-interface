This client contains functions to interact with Wasp and GoShimmer.

As currently no Java/TypeScript library for this exists, we ship it with the PoC.

Our ambition is to create a client based on the learnings of PoCs and community feedback

so we can build a library that is easy to use which keeps the entry barrier low.
